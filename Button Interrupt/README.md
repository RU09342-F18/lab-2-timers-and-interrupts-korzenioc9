# Button Interrupt

## Task
"Your goal for this part of the lab is to replicate your button code from Lab 2, where the LED should change states only when the button is pressed. This can be extended to include behaviors such as only have the LED on when the button is depressed, or have the LED blink one color when pressed and another when it is let go. Another behavior extends from the second lab which is speed control based on the button presses. For example, have the rate of the LED cycle between a "low", "Medium", and "High" rate of speed."


# Implementation
For this portion of the lab I used boards MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529.
