# Button Based Delay

## Task
"Setup your microcontroller to initially blink and LED at a rate of 10Hz upon restarting or powering up. Then utilizing one of the buttons on board, a user should be able to set the delay or blinking rate of the LED by holding down a button. The duration in which the button is depressed should then become the new rate at which the LED blinks. As previously stated, you most likely will want to take advantage of the fact that TIMER modules exist and see if you can let them do a bulk of the work for you."


## Implementation
For this portion of the lab I used boards MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529.
